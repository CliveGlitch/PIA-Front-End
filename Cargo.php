        <span>Its dreariness highlighted by seemingly colorful appearances, this dystopian study daringly presents us with a world based upon a metaphor taken literally. “Everything has lost weight, things have flown into space”; upon this foundation, the game builds a thought-provoking narrative, contemplating the importance of cultural heritage, history, and artifacts of everyday life. Thrown into a phantasmagoric world, Flox wants to restore it to normality by extracting FUN from all around her. But can FUN ground us in this world? Can it make the world meaningful again? These are the questions the player will have to ponder.<br><br>Oh, and also you can totally kick weird naked people.</span>
